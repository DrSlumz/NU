                                Korn, which is considered a pioneering act of
                                the nu metal genre. Davis's distinctive
                                personality and Korn's music influenced a
                                generation of musicians and performers who have
                                come after them.

                                    that mimicked a turntablist's various
                                    effects and rumbling down-tuned riffing)
                                    that defined the nu metal aesthetic
                                    beginning in the mid-'90s.
